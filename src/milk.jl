Hi Xijiang

It seems the DRP donâ€™t work well.  Even when using EBV, the use of weights does
not work well.  Please try to use deregressed EBV Garrick et al.  (Genetics
Selection Evolution 2009 41:55)

Basically:

DRP = EBV/R2

DRP = deregressed proof which is to be analysed; R2 = reliability of the EBV = EDC / (EDC+lambda)

EDC = effective daughter contributions

Lambda = (4-h2)/h2 if EDC reflects number of daughters; h2 is heritability being used.

If EDC reflects effective number of records; lamda is from animal model.

The weight of the deregressed proofs is: lambda*R2/(1-R2)

Correction which does not affect relative weights but actual weights so that they are on the correct scale.
